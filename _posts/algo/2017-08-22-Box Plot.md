Box Plot is method to discrete data analysis, which can be used to recognize the abnormal values in the data set.
<!--more-->

It uses the 1/4 and 3/4 percentile numbers to determin the abnormal values and tet Q1 and Q3 denote those two numbers separately. Then the method treat the number numbers small than Q1-1.5*IQR or larger than Q3+1.5*IQR abnormal. In which, IQR=Q3-Q1. In practice, this is a effective method to remove abnormal numbers.
