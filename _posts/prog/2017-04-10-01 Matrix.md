Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

## Methodology
To calculate the distances of each cell, the least (lower bound) time complexity must be O(nm) (For a matrix of n lines and m columns). For the cells number of the matrix is nm. For each cells(except the cells on the four sides of the matrix), there's four neighbours: up, down, left, right. So when we determin the value of a cell, all we need to do is to look at these four neightbours.

But how we calculate the value of the neighbours ? The answer we don't know them all, but we can calculate the partial optimal which only look at two neighbours (up + left or down + right) by one traverse. So with two times traverse (one bout): one from the left-top corner to the right-down corner and the other contrary, we can calculate the value of each cells. Both the time and space comlexity of this method is O(mn).

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<std::vector<int> > updateMatrix(std::vector<std::vector<int> >& matrix) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int> > result(matrix.size(), std::vector<int>(matrix[0].size(), INT_MAX));
        //
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].size(); ++j) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 0) result[i][j] = 0;
                else {
                    if (i > 0 && result[i - 1][j] < result[i][j]){
                        result[i][j] = result[i - 1][j] + 1;
                    }
                    if (j > 0 && result[i][j - 1] < result[i][j]){
                        result[i][j] = result[i][j - 1] + 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        //
        for (int i = matrix.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = matrix[0].size() - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 0) result[i][j] = 0;
                else {
                    if (i < matrix.size() - 1 && result[i + 1][j] < result[i][j]){
                        result[i][j] = result[i + 1][j] + 1;
                    }
                    if (j < matrix[0].size() - 1 && result[i][j + 1] < result[i][j]){
                        result[i][j] = result[i][j + 1] + 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
