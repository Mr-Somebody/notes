## Methodology

### O(n^2) Method
Peek a number *A* from the array, then scan all the other numbers to see if they sum to *T* with *A*.

### O(nlogn) Method

1. Sort the array into nondescend order in time complex O(nlogn) (eg. use quick sort).
2. Peek two pointers: *s* and *e*. Initialize *s* with the first element and *e* with the last element.
3. Calculate sum of data at *s* and *e* as *T'* util *s* is noless than *e*.
4. If *T'* equals to *T*, finded.
5. If *T'* is greater than *T*, decrease *e* by 1. Otherwise, increase *s* by 1.
6. Go back to 3.

The steps from 2 to 6 denote O(n) complex. So the total time complex of this process is O(nlog(n)) + O(n), wich is O(nlog(n)).

### O(n) Method

Use hash map to story every number in the array. And then peek a number *A* in the array and see if *T-A* in the hashmap.
