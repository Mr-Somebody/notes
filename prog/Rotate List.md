## Description
>Given a list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.
>
>For example:
>Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL and k = 2,
>return 4->5->1->2->3->NULL.

## Methodology

### O(n) Method

#### Brief
Rotate a list by *k* means mv tail *k* elements front. The straight-forward method is rotate the list *k* times and each time move the last element first. The time complex of straight-forward method is O(n^2), which is inefficient.

More efficient method is to move tail *k* elements together, which is method introduced below.

#### Steps
1. Count the length of list as *N*.
2. Mod *k* by *N*:ã€€*k = k % N*.
3. Create a pointer *pre* and move it *N - k - 1* steps, then the new head of the rotated list is *pre->next* and assign *pre->next* to a new pointer *nhead = pre->next*.
4. Create another pointer *node = pre->next* and move it to the last node.
5. Set *node->next = pre* and set *pre->next=NULL*.
6. Return new head *nhead*.

## Source Code
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* rotateRight(ListNode* head, int k) {
        if (k == 0 || head == NULL) return head;
        // Find end
        int num = 1;
        ListNode* end = head;
        while (end->next != NULL) {
            end = end->next;
            ++num;
        }
        //
        k = k % num;
        if (k == 0) {
            return head;
        }
        ListNode* pre = head;
        int i = num - k - 1;
        while (i > 0) {
            pre = pre->next;
            --i;
        }
        ListNode* nhead = pre->next;
        //printf("A:%d,k=%d\n", nhead->val, k);
        ListNode* node = pre->next;
        while (node->next) {
            node = node->next;
        }
        node->next = head;
        pre->next = NULL;
        return nhead;
    }
};
```
